# Python auth-microservice with configuration-gen framework

Made by Aaron Iziyaev for a school project, in my team will do the infra. I thought it was fun to try.

It's a partial implemetation as you see nothing on the "auth" side of things is implemented, but just a template we can grow from and use the config framework I've built for this.
